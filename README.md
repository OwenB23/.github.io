# Portfolio of Owen Bond

### Welcome to my personal portfolio! Here, you will find a collection of my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript projects that showcase my skills and creativity as a web developer. Feel free to explore and get a glimpse of what I can do!

## Project 1 / Social Media Tracker

### This Display page is a challenge i wanted to duplicate from "FrontEndMentor.io". I took the image of the webpage they had provided and completely built my own version from scratch. There was no starter code or guidance of any kind. This display webpage allows you to see your social media stats in a beautiful organized fashion. You also have the option to switch to a light / dark mode! 

## Project 2 / Foodery

### Foodery is a project i decided to continue working on after my bootcamp. In the course we worked on implementing the images and styling themcorrectly, but not much detail, I wanted to bring it to life! So i decided to create a fully functioning recipe webpage that has an API to searc for your favorite recipes. I used a combination of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript and Jquery to build this webpage. This is one of my first projects ever created.  


##Project 3 / Spring Lane Cinemas

### For this particular project i was really trying to practice my Bootstrap and Jquery skills alone. Spring Lane Cinemas is a movie showtime webpage that displays movie details, times, and a way to sign up for rewards. Build with only Bootstrap and JQuery. This project is sleek with minimal code needed. 


## Project 4 / To-Do List App

### The To-Do List App is designed to streamline your daily task management, making it easy to keep track of your to-do items. Using HTML, CSS and JavaScript i was able to create this application that is user friendly and a simple way to practice my javaScript.
