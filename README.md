# Owen Bond Portfolio

## Welcome to my portfolio website! I'm Owen Bond, and this is my showcase of various projects created using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, Node.js, Express.js, and more. In this README, I'll provide an overview of how I built this portfolio site, its features, and how you can get in touch with me.

## This portfolio website was designed and built with a focus on simplicity, usability, and showcasing my skills as a developer. Here's how I put it all together:
#### -HTML: The foundation of this site is built using HTML to structure the content and provide a solid base for the design.
### -CSS: CSS was used extensively for styling and layout, ensuring an appealing and responsive design across various devices and screen sizes.
### -Bootstrap: I incorporated Bootstrap, a popular CSS framework, to streamline the design process and ensure a consistent and professional look and feel.
### -JavaScript: JavaScript was used to enhance interactivity, add dynamic features, and create a smooth user experience.
